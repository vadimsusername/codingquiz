# codingquiz

For this assignment we had to make a website which had a quiz on some subject.
There has to be a timer which would be decreased when a question is answered incorrectly. When the quiz is finished a score is given and the user can enter their initials to save their score. There is also a high scores page which shows the initials and scores of previous quizes.

The website can be found at the following url:
